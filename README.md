First Repeating Element Finder

This is a beginner-level Python script that identifies the **first repeating element** in a given list of integers. The program demonstrates the use of:

- Nested loops
- List iteration
- Conditional checks
- Loop control with `break`

No advanced data structures (like sets or dictionaries) are used, making this perfect for learners building foundational logic skills.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

The program loops through each item in the list and compares it with the rest. As soon as it finds a duplicate, it prints that number and exits the loop.

### ðŸ”§ Example

```python
Input: [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1]
Output: First repeating element is: 2
